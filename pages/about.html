						Pro Plastics is an awesome business that does awesome things.
						For example, have you ever even met Dan McMahon? Like the dude
						is a motherfucking legend. Before you can confidently call your
						company successful, you have to have done business with Dan.
						Are you a jealous man and worried he will take your wife and kids?
						Don't sweat it, he has a freakishly tiny penis. I'm talking really
						small. And that's the feeling Pro Plastics is willing to give you
						and your company.

							run by THE Dan MOTHER-FUCKING McMahon.</li><br/> 

							<li>I can't believe none of you have had the balls to call this 
							fucker and give him all of your business.</li><br/>

							<li>There literally is no other reason to have a business then to 
							give your money to this absolute tycoon.</li><br/>
		
							<li>Chuck Norris was once asked if he would rather fight superman 
							in real life, or stop giving Dan McMahon his money.</li><br/>

							<li>Without time to catch a breath he replied, "Superman better 
							start training".</li>
